# Option A: Personal Library App Development Plan

## Project Overview

Build a personal library application where users can search for books/movies, add them to their collection, edit details, mark favorites, track reading status, and organize their library. This project combines React Router for navigation, Context API and React hooks for state management, and requires integration with one or more public APIs.

## Important: Project Structure Connection

**CRITICAL:** Your app needs proper folder organization to work correctly:

```
src/
├── context/
│   ├── LibraryContext.jsx    # Library items context provider
│   └── ThemeContext.jsx       # Theme/preferences context
├── hooks/
│   ├── useLocalStorage.js     # Custom hook for localStorage
│   ├── useLibrary.js          # Custom hook for library operations
│   └── useAPI.js              # Custom hook for API calls
├── pages/
│   ├── Library.jsx            # Main library view
│   ├── Search.jsx             # Search and add items
│   ├── Favorites.jsx          # Favorited items
│   └── ItemDetails.jsx        # Single item details
├── components/
│   ├── Navigation.jsx         # App navigation
│   ├── LibraryItem.jsx        # Single library item card
│   └── SearchResults.jsx      # Search result display
├── App.jsx                    # Routes and context providers
└── main.jsx                   # App entry point
```

## Essential State Variables

**IMPORTANT:** Your app needs to track state with Context API and useState. Plan these structures:

**Library Context State:** (Context is Optional)
- items: Array of all library items
- loading: Boolean for async operations
- error: String for error messages
- favorites: Array of favorited item IDs

**Theme Context State (Optional):**
- theme: String ("light" or "dark")
- preferences: Object with user settings

**Item Object Structure:**
Your items should contain:
- id: Unique identifier
- title: Book/movie title
- author: Creator name
- thumbnail: Image URL
- description: Full description text
- isFavorite: Boolean flag
- readingStatus: String ("want-to-read", "reading", "completed", or "not-started")
- genre: Category or genre
- rating: User rating (optional)
- dateAdded: Timestamp when added to library

## Core Functionality Requirements

### 1. Context API Setup & State Lifting
- Create LibraryContext with createContext
- Build LibraryProvider component with useState for items
- Lift state from child components to context when shared across multiple components
- Wrap app with provider in App.jsx
- Export useContext hook for easy consumption
- Handle state updates immutably

### 2. Custom Hooks
- Create useLocalStorage hook for data persistence
- Create useLibrary hook to encapsulate library operations
- Create useAPI hook for fetching data from external API
- Make hooks reusable across components

### 3. React Router Setup
- Set up BrowserRouter in App.jsx
- Define routes for Library, Search, Favorites, Details pages
- Use Link or NavLink for navigation
- Implement useNavigate for programmatic navigation
- Handle 404 with catch-all route

### 4. API Integration (REQUIRED)
- Choose an API (Google Books API recommended - no key required)
- MUST integrate at least one external API for fetching book/movie data
- Create async functions to fetch data
- Handle loading and error states during API calls
- Parse API response into your item structure
- Display results in a user-friendly format

### 5. Immutable State Updates
- Update objects using spread operator
- Update nested objects by spreading all levels
- Add/remove array items using filter, map, concat
- Use functional updates with setState for previous state access

### 6. Library Management (CRUD Operations)
- CREATE: Add items from search results to library
- READ: Display all library items in a grid or list
- UPDATE: Edit item details (title, author, notes, status)
- DELETE: Remove items from library immutably
- Mark items as favorites
- Update reading status (want-to-read, reading, completed)
- Filter library by status, genre, favorites, rating
- Sort library by title, author, date added, rating

### 7. Search Functionality
- Create search form with input field
- Make API request based on search query
- Display search results
- Allow adding items from results to library
- Handle no results scenario

### 8. Item Details View
- Create detail page accessible by item ID
- Use useParams to get ID from URL
- Display full item information
- Show larger image and complete description
- Provide actions (add to library, favorite, remove)

## Development Strategy

### Phase 1: Project Foundation
1. Create React app with Vite
2. Install dependencies (react-router-dom only - no Redux)
3. Set up folder structure with context/ and hooks/ folders
4. Create basic page components (empty for now)
5. Set up routing in App.jsx
6. Test navigation between pages

### Phase 2: Context API & State Setup
1. Create LibraryContext.jsx with createContext
2. Build LibraryProvider with useState for items array
3. Add functions to add, remove, toggle favorite items
4. Wrap App with LibraryProvider
5. Test context values are accessible in components

### Phase 3: Custom Hooks
1. Create useLocalStorage hook for persisting data
2. Create useLibrary hook to consume LibraryContext
3. Create useAPI hook for fetch operations with loading/error states
4. Test hooks work correctly in components

### Phase 4: Display Library
1. Create LibraryItem component to display single item
2. Use useLibrary hook to get items from context
3. Map over items and render LibraryItem components
4. Handle empty library state with message
5. Test that hardcoded items display correctly

### Phase 5: Add Items Manually (No API Yet)
1. Create temporary form in Search page
2. Use useLibrary to add items with immutable updates
3. Verify items appear in Library page
4. Test remove and favorite functionality
5. Confirm state updates correctly without mutations

### Phase 6: API Integration
1. Choose and test API endpoint in browser
2. Implement useAPI custom hook with async/await
3. Handle loading state during fetch
4. Handle errors from API with try/catch
5. Parse API response into your item format
6. Display results with add buttons

### Phase 7: LocalStorage Persistence
1. Integrate useLocalStorage hook with LibraryContext
2. Save library items to localStorage on every update
3. Load items from localStorage on app initialization
4. Test data persists after page refresh
5. Handle edge cases (empty storage, corrupted data)

### Phase 8: Polish & Features
1. Add CSS styling for professional appearance
2. Implement favorites filtering
3. Add item details page with routing
4. Handle edge cases (duplicate items, empty searches)
5. Add proper error messages and loading states
6. Ensure all state updates are immutable

## Component Organization Best Practices

### Component Structure
- Keep components small and focused (single responsibility)
- Separate presentation components from container components
- Extract reusable UI elements into separate components
- Use clear, descriptive component names

### Props Management
- Define expected props clearly
- Use prop destructuring for readability
- Pass only necessary props to child components
- Consider prop-types or TypeScript for validation

### Event Handling
- Use descriptive handler names (handleAddItem, handleSearch)
- Keep handlers in the component that owns the state
- Pass handlers down as props when needed
- Use functional updates when depending on previous state

## Key React Hooks & Methods You'll Use

**React Hooks:**
- useState() - Local component state
- useEffect() - Side effects (API calls, localStorage)
- useContext() - Consume context values
- useCallback() - Memoize callback functions (optional)
- useMemo() - Memoize expensive calculations (optional)

**React Router:**
- BrowserRouter - Enable routing
- Routes and Route - Define routes
- Link / NavLink - Navigation links
- useNavigate() - Programmatic navigation
- useParams() - Get URL parameters

**Context API:**
- createContext() - Create context object
- Context.Provider - Provide values to component tree
- useContext() - Consume context in components

**Immutable Updates:**
- Spread operator (...) - Copy objects/arrays
- Array.map() - Transform array items
- Array.filter() - Remove items from array
- Array.concat() / [...arr, item] - Add items to array

**API Handling:**
- fetch() - Make API requests
- async/await - Handle asynchronous operations
- try/catch - Error handling
- response.json() - Parse JSON response

## Testing Your Functions

### Method 1: Chrome Developer Tools

Open DevTools (F12) and test:

**Check Context State:**
- Use React DevTools extension
- Inspect component tree
- View context values in components
- Watch state changes as you interact

**Check Routes:**
- Navigate between pages
- Check URL changes correctly
- Test back/forward browser buttons
- Verify 404 page for invalid routes

**Check LocalStorage:**
- Open Application tab in DevTools
- View localStorage entries
- Verify data saves correctly
- Test loading from storage on refresh

### Method 2: Interactive Testing

Test user scenarios:
- Search for items using API
- Add items to library
- Navigate to library and see items
- Mark items as favorites
- Filter to show only favorites
- View item details page
- Remove items from library
- Refresh page (data should persist)

### Method 3: Edge Case Testing

Test unusual scenarios:
- Search with empty query
- Search for nonsense that returns no results
- Add same item twice (should handle duplicates)
- Remove all items from library
- Navigate directly to invalid item ID
- Test on mobile screen size
- Clear localStorage and reload app

## Debugging Tips

1. **Context Not Working**: Ensure component is wrapped in Provider
2. **State Not Updating**: Check you're not mutating state directly
3. **Routing Problems**: Verify route paths match Link destinations exactly
4. **API Errors**: Log full API response to see structure
5. **LocalStorage Issues**: Check Application tab to see stored data
6. **Props Undefined**: Verify parent component is passing props correctly

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Not wrapping app with Provider**: Context won't work without Provider in App.jsx
2. **Mutating state directly**: Always create new objects/arrays with spread operator
3. **Forgetting functional updates**: Use setState(prev => ...) when depending on previous state
4. **No loading states**: Always show loading indicators during API calls
5. **Not handling API errors**: Always try/catch API requests
6. **Hardcoding API keys in code**: Use environment variables for sensitive data
7. **Not persisting to localStorage**: Call localStorage.setItem after state updates
8. **Forgetting dependencies in useEffect**: Add all dependencies to dependency array

## API Recommendations

### Google Books API (Recommended - No Key Required)

**Search Endpoint:**
- Base URL: https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes
- Query parameter: ?q=search+term
- Example: https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes?q=javascript

**Response Structure:**
- Returns items array
- Each item has volumeInfo object with title, authors, description, imageLinks

**No API key needed** for basic usage (perfect for learning projects)

### Open Library API (Alternative)

**Search Endpoint:**
- Base URL: https://openlibrary.org/search.json
- Query parameter: ?q=search+term
- No API key required

### OMDB API (For Movies - Requires Free Key)

**Search Endpoint:**
- Base URL: http://www.omdbapi.com/
- Requires free API key from omdbapi.com
- Query parameters: ?apikey=YOUR_KEY&s=search+term
