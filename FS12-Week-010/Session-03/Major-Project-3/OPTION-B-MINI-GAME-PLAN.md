# Option B: Mini Game Development Plan

## Project Overview

Build an interactive mini-game using React Router for navigation between game screens, Context API and React hooks for managing game state, and integration with one or more external APIs. Examples include: quiz game with trivia API, memory match with image API, typing game with quote API, or word guessing game with dictionary API.

## Important: Project Structure Connection

**CRITICAL:** Your game needs proper folder organization:

```
src/
├── context/
│   ├── GameContext.jsx       # Game state context provider
│   └── PlayerContext.jsx     # Player data context
├── hooks/
│   ├── useLocalStorage.js    # Custom hook for localStorage
│   ├── useGame.js            # Custom hook for game operations
│   └── useTimer.js           # Custom hook for game timer
├── pages/
│   ├── Home.jsx              # Welcome screen
│   ├── Game.jsx              # Main game screen
│   ├── GameOver.jsx          # Game over screen
│   └── Leaderboard.jsx       # High scores
├── components/
│   ├── Navigation.jsx        # App navigation
│   ├── GameBoard.jsx         # Main game component
│   ├── ScoreDisplay.jsx      # Score and stats
│   └── Timer.jsx             # Game timer (if needed)
├── App.jsx                   # Routes and context providers
└── main.jsx                  # App entry point
```

## Essential State Variables

**IMPORTANT:** Your game needs to track state with Context API and useState. Plan these structures:

**Game Context State:**
- score: Current score number
- level: Current level/difficulty
- gameStatus: String ("idle", "playing", "paused", "gameOver")
- timeRemaining: Time left in seconds (if timed game)

**Player Context State:**
- playerName: String username
- highScores: Array of score objects
- gamesPlayed: Total games counter

**Game-Specific State (varies by game type):**
For Quiz: questions array, currentQuestion index, selectedAnswer, correctAnswers count
For Memory: cards array, flippedCards array, matchedPairs counter
For Typing: targetText string, userInput string, wordsPerMinute number
For Snake: snakePosition array, foodPosition object, direction string

## Core Functionality Requirements

### 1. Context API Setup & State Lifting (Context is optional)

- Respond to user actions immediately
- Provide visual feedback for actions
- Play sound effects (optional)
- Show animations for game events

## Development Strategy

3. Set up folder structure with context/ and hooks/ folders
4. Create basic page components
5. Set up routing
6. Test navigation works

### Phase 2: Context API & State Setup

2. Use useGame hook to access/update state
3. Update UI based on context state
4. Test state updates correctly across components
5. Verify all updates are immutable

### Phase 7: LocalStorage Persistence
1. Integrate useLocalStorage with PlayerContext
2. Save high scores after each game

2. Implement pause feature
3. Add high score tracking
4. Create leaderboard page
5. Add CSS styling
6. Add sound effects (optional)

## Component Organization Best Practices

### Component Structure
- Keep components small and focused (single responsibility)
- Separate game logic from presentation components
- Extract reusable game elements into components
- Use clear, descriptive component names

### Props Management
- Define expected props clearly
- Use prop destructuring for readability
- Pass only necessary props to child components
- Avoid prop drilling by using Context

### Event Handling
- Use descriptive handler names (handleKeyPress, handleCardFlip)
- Keep handlers in the component that owns the state
- Use functional updates for state that depends on previous value
- Clean up event listeners in useEffect

## Key React Hooks & Methods You'll Use

**React Hooks:**
- useState() - Local game state
- useEffect() - Game loop, timers, cleanup
- useContext() - Consume game/player context
- useRef() - Track previous values, intervals
- useCallback() - Optimize event handlers (optional)

**React Router:**
- BrowserRouter - Enable routing
- Routes and Route - Define game screens
- Link / NavLink - Navigation
- useNavigate() - Programmatic navigation (go to game over)
- useLocation() - Access passed state (score data)

**Context API:**
- createContext() - Create context objects
- Context.Provider - Provide values to component tree
- useContext() - Consume context in components

**Immutable Updates:**
- Spread operator (...) - Copy objects/arrays
- Array.map() - Transform array items
- Array.filter() - Remove items
- Array.concat() / [...arr, item] - Add items

**Game Logic:**
- setInterval() / setTimeout() - Timers
- addEventListener() - Keyboard/mouse input
- Math.random() - Random game elements
- Date.now() - Timestamp for scoring
- localStorage - Persist high scores

## Testing Your Functions

### Method 1: Chrome Developer Tools

Open DevTools (F12) and test:

**Check Context State:**
- Use React DevTools extension
- Inspect component tree
- View context values
- Watch state changes during gameplay

**Check Game Logic:**
- Console.log user inputs
- Verify score calculations
- Test win/lose detection
- Monitor timer accuracy

**Check LocalStorage:**
- Open Application tab
- View localStorage entries
- Verify scores save correctly
- Test loading on refresh

### Method 2: Interactive Testing

Play the game and test:
- Start game from home screen
- Play through complete game
- Verify score increases correctly
- Test pause functionality
- Reach game over condition
- Check high score saves
- View leaderboard
- Play multiple rounds

### Method 3: Edge Case Testing

Test unusual scenarios:
- Spam click/keypress rapidly
- Pause and unpause repeatedly
- Navigate away mid-game (back button)
- Try to start multiple games simultaneously
- Test with very high scores
- Test localStorage when empty
- Refresh page mid-game

## Debugging Tips

1. **Context Not Working**: Ensure component is wrapped in Provider
2. **Timer Issues**: Clear intervals on component unmount with useEffect cleanup
3. **Input Lag**: Use useCallback for event handlers to optimize performance
4. **State Not Updating**: Ensure you're not mutating state directly
5. **Score Not Saving**: Check localStorage in Application tab of DevTools
6. **Navigation Problems**: Verify you're using navigate() correctly

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Not wrapping app with Provider**: Context won't work without Provider
2. **Not clearing intervals**: Always cleanup timers in useEffect return function
3. **Multiple event listeners**: Remove listeners on unmount to prevent memory leaks
4. **Direct state mutation**: Always create new objects/arrays with spread operator
5. **Forgetting functional updates**: Use setState(prev => ...) for timers/scores
6. **Forgetting to persist**: Save high scores to localStorage after each game
7. **Hardcoding game data**: Use configuration objects for easy tweaking
8. **No loading state**: Show feedback while game initializes
